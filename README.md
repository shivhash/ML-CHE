# Air Quality Data Analysis and Relative Humidity Prediction

## Objective
- Gain practical exposure to machine learning algorithms applied in analyzing air quality data.
- Develop a predictive model for relative humidity using 13 air quality indicators to enhance field forecasting accuracy.

## Approach
- Learn Generalised Linear Models (GLMs), Neural Networks, and Locally Weighted Regression fundamentals.
- Perform data cleaning, pre-processing, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Air Quality Index dataset.
